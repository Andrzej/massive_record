# v0.2.0 (git develop)


# v0.1.2 (git master)





# v0.1.1

- A ORM record now now if it is read only or not.
- Added a logger to ORM::Base, which is set to Rails.logger if gem is used with Rails.
- The database cleaner will no longer destroy tables, only delete all of their contents between tests. Speed tests up a lot.
- known_attribute_names are now available as instance method as well.
- If you add a created_at attribute it will be maintained by the ORM with the time the object was created.
- An adapter (wrapper) row now has an updated_at attribute. ORM objects also responds to updated_at
- Bugfix: Database cleaner no longer tries to remove tables with same name twice.



# v0.1.0
